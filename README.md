# Human-Activity-Recognition
This Repository consists of project Human activity recognition using ML Algorithms.
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities:

1.WALKING
2.WALKING UPSTAIRS
3.WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
4.SITTING
5.STANDING
6.LAYING

 by wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
